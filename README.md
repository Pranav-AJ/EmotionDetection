State-of-the-art facial expression methods outperform human beings, especially, thanks to the success of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, most of the existing works focus mainly on analyzing an adult’s face and ignore the important problems: how can we recognize facial expression from a baby’s face image and how difficult is it? In this project , we first introduce a new face image dataset, which contains 1000 images from babies younger than two years old, and each image is with one of seven facial expressions (i.e., happy, sad, neutral, surprised ,angry, disgusted, fearful). However, humans' facial expression has similar patterns, and it is very confusing in recognizing the expression using naked eye. For instance, afraid and surprised is very similar to one another. Thus, this will lead to confusion in determining the facial expression. The Deep Learning based technique, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is implemented in this project. The methodology involves capturing live video streams using OpenCV, which handles real-time image processing and face detection. A CNN, specifically trained on a diverse dataset of baby facial expressions, is used to classify seven distinct emotions: happy, sad, angry, surprised, scared, disgusted, and neutral. Data preprocessing and augmentation techniques are employed to ensure the model's robustness and accuracy across various conditions, including different lighting and facial variations
